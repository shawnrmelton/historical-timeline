# Historical Timeline Explorer

A multi-topic historical timeline that allows users to explore how events across different areas (wars, science, art, etc.) unfolded simultaneously throughout history.

## Features

- **Multi-Topic Comparison**: Add up to 5 historical topics and see their events aligned on a unified timeline
- **Synchronized Scrolling**: All timeline tracks scroll together to maintain temporal alignment
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Interactive Search**: Search for historical topics and dynamically load event data
- **Color-Coded Topics**: Each topic gets its own color for easy visual distinction
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Automatically fetches historical events from Wikipedia

## Live Demo

ðŸš€ **[View Live Site](https://your-site.vercel.app)** (will be your URL after deployment)

## Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shawnrmelton/historical-timeline.git
   cd historical-timeline
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   Simply open `index.html` in your browser for local development

3. **For API testing**
   You'll need to deploy to Vercel to test the Wikipedia API integration

## Deployment to Vercel

2. **Import your repository** from your GitHub account
3. **Deploy** - Vercel will automatically detect this as a static site with serverless functions
